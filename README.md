**[CS 2420 Fall 2022] Simple Spreadsheet**
-------------------------------------------

This is a straight-forward simple spreadsheet application built using C# and .NET Maui designed to organize data, sort numbers, and 
compute simple algebraic calculations. 

This project was made in my CS 2420 class to practice C#, GUI, and the Visual Studio IDE. A screenshot of the spreadsheet in action is below.
